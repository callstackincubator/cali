  ü™Ñ An AI agent for building React Native apps 
</p>

---

```bash
$ npx cali
```

## Wait, what?

Cali is an AI agent that helps you build React Native apps. It takes all the utilities and functions of a React Native CLI and exposes them as tools to an LLM.

Thanks to that, an LLM can help you with your React Native app development, without the need to remember commands, spending time troubleshooting errors, and in the future, much more.

## How can I use it?

You can use Cali in two ways:

- [`cali`](./packages/cali/README.md) - AI agent that runs in your terminal. Ready to use out of the box.
- [`@cali/tools-react-native`](./packages/tools/README.md) - Collection of tools for building React Native apps with [Vercel AI SDK](https://github.com/ai-sdk/ai)
- [`@cali/mcp-server`](./packages/mcp-server/README.md) - (soon) [MCP server](http://modelcontextprotocol.io) for using Cali with Claude and other compatible environments

## What can it do?

Cali is still in the early stages of development, but it already supports:

- **Build Automation**: Running and building React Native apps on iOS and Android
- **Device Management**: Listing and managing connected Android and iOS devices and simulators
- **Dependency Management**: Install and manage npm packages and CocoaPods dependencies.
- **React Native Library Search**: Searching and listing React Native libraries from [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory)

You can learn more about available tools [here](./packages/tools/README.md).

#### Troubleshooting an error

[TBD]

## Future requests

I like the idea of an AI agent for building React Native apps. I would like to play around with this idea in public, and see where it goes.

Feel free to open an issue or a discussion to suggest ideas or report bugs. Happy to hear from you! üëã
